# Map Field to Struct

This Go function, `mapFieldToStruct`, is designed to create a map from a specified field of a single exchangeable struct. It allows you to map a specific field of the struct to the struct itself.

## Function Signature

```go
func mapFieldToStruct[T any](s T, field string) (map[string]T, error)
```
‍‍`s`: The exchangeable struct.
`field`: The name of the field (specified as a JSON tag) to create the map from.


# Usage
Define your exchangeable struct with JSON tags:

go ```
type ExchangeableStruct struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Age  int    `json:"age"`
	// Add more fields as needed
}
```
Use the mapFieldToStruct function to create a map from a specified field:

go ```
s := ExchangeableStruct{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}

nameMap, err := mapFieldToStruct(s, "name")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    return
}

ageMap, err := mapFieldToStruct(s, "age")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    return
}
```
# Return Values
The function returns a map where the keys are the values of the specified field in the struct, and the values are the provided struct.
An error is returned if the specified field does not exist in the struct.
Notes
Ensure that the field name provided matches the JSON tag of the struct field.


This README file provides information on how to use the `mapFieldToStruct` function with a single struct and a specified field, along with error handling. Feel free to customize and expand upon it to fit your project's requirements!
